	•	The users created by admin will be regular users their setting will only be, change password and change contact info (phone and email) only organizational 
		emails will be permitted e.g...@shadygrovehospital.org. We will obviously have a save button and if possible have a button to navigate back to dashboard.

15.	Above calendar on the left side replace today button with “fill in availability” and a “Edit availability” button. 
	•	Fill in availability will allow the doctor user to fill in available dates of choice that will be display on the hospital side. This button will take them to
		the same calendar but with options to select a tile. Once a tile is selected a pop screen appears prompting for “Select time availability”. This will be a 
		scroll down time availability list from 12AM to 12AM. Once date and times are selected they will be display on main calendar on an un-editable pop-up window 
		showing available times as will show on the doctor’s side. The only option allowed on this window is reschedule if the hospital has already scheduled a patient 
		on that date. On reschedule allow edits on time and date only. After reschedule button is hit prompt the following warning, “Are you sure you want to 
		reschedule this appointment?” ‘Yes’, ‘No’
	•	Edit availability will allow the doctor to go back to the editable calendar and edit availability dates only if the hospital has not scheduled any patients 
		on that tile. Otherwise they will have to use the reschedule option. 
	•	On the new appointment pop-up window use same format as “add” pop-up window (in the patient management section) except Remove FIN and Transitional Care Eligible. 
		Change Type INS to “Insurance Company” Under insurance remove check box and add yes or no radio buttons. If ‘no’ then ‘Insurance company disappears, If ‘Yes’ then 
		insurance company is selected from drop down and add the scheduling options under the new appointment pop-up window (Date, Time options). Change “Create 
		to “Schedule” add a cancel option button. Prompt warning after scheduling button is hit prompt the warning "Are you sure you are ready to schedule? 
	•	Save the patient info to patient management after scheduling new appointment.
16.	Refer to color scheme for tiles on ppt page 7. Ignore everything else for now.
17.	Under patient management remove FIN field or replace with Discharge doctor field. Please redesign the search box it’s confusing. Currently appears as a row 
	under patient management.
